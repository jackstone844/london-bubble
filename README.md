# london-bubble

This is a sample application I started to learn the React & Redux ecosystem.

# The purpose

This application is simply a browser client 'blog' that displays venues around London.

It requests the Venue data from a Google Firebase Database & the images of Venues from Google Firebase Storage. 

The main objective while developing this project was:

Develop a more complex application, where lots of components are defined and also, where data are fetched from an external resource.
